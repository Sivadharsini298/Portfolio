### 2. IPL 2008–2023 Data Analysis Project
**Code:** [`IPL(2008-2023)Statistical_Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/Sivadharsini298/Portfolio/blob/main/IPL(2008-2023)Statistical_Analysis.ipynb)

**Goal:** To statistically analyze IPL (2008–2023) data and uncover how toss outcomes, innings strategies, and match decisions impact winning chances, supported by hypothesis testing and visual insights.

**Description:** This project analyzes ball-by-ball data from IPL seasons 2008 to 2023 to uncover patterns and test hypotheses about match outcomes.

**Skills:** Data Loading and Preprocessing, Statistical Analysis - Hypothesis Testing, Visualizations.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statistical Tests (Chi-Square, T-Test).

**Results:** The analysis revealed, Winning the toss does not guarantee match victory. Chasing has emerged as a more successful strategy, especially in recent IPL seasons.
